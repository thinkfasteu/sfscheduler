> **Archived:** The schedule tab has been fully rebuilt and reintegrated as of October 2025.

This file described emergency rebuilding steps when the schedule tab was temporarily removed. The current application already includes the schedule UI, event bindings, and workflows. Refer to the updated `README.md`, `docs/QUICK_REFERENCE_GUIDE.md`, and `ui/scheduleUI.js` for the authoritative implementation notes.

Historical context is retained in git history. This placeholder remains only to signal that no further action is required.
