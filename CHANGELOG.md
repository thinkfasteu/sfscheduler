### Database Changes

#### Migration 008: Practical Weekly Hour Limits
```sql
-- Add practical hour limit columns to contracts table
ALTER TABLE contracts ADD COLUMN weekly_hours_min_practical INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE contracts ADD COLUMN weekly_hours_max_practical INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE contracts ADD COLUMN notes_practical_caps TEXT;

-- Set default values based on contract type
UPDATE contracts SET 
  weekly_hours_min_practical = CASE 
    WHEN type = 'Minijob' THEN GREATEST(contract_hours - 2, 8)
    WHEN type = 'Student' THEN GREATEST(contract_hours - 2, 18)
    ELSE contract_hours - 4
  END,
  weekly_hours_max_practical = CASE 
    WHEN type = 'Minijob' THEN LEAST(contract_hours + 2, 12)
    WHEN type = 'Student' THEN LEAST(contract_hours + 2, 22)  
    ELSE contract_hours + 4
  END
WHERE weekly_hours_min_practical IS NULL OR weekly_hours_max_practical IS NULL;
```

**Migration Safety Notes:**
- ‚úÖ **Backward Compatible**: Existing code gracefully falls back to contract hours when practical limits are null
- ‚úÖ **Data Preservation**: All existing contract data maintained during migration
- ‚úÖ **Rollback Safe**: Can be reverted by dropping added columns without data loss
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Validation Required**: Ensure min ‚â§ max practical hours after migration

### Breaking Changes

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è API Changes
- **Enhanced `getEffectiveWeeklyLimits()` method signature**
  - Now returns object with `min`, `max`, and `target` properties
  - Previous single-value return is deprecated but supported
  - Update calling code to use structured return values

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è UI Behavioral Changes
- **Minijob swap confirmations** now required for earnings-impacting changes
- **Monitoring tab** added to main navigation (may affect custom UI modifications)
- **Practical hours fields** visible for relevant contract types only

### Security Enhancements

#### üîí GDPR Compliance
- **Complete privacy framework** with lawful basis documentation
- **Data subject rights procedures** with automated request handling
- **Breach notification protocols** with timeline compliance
- **Processor agreement templates** for third-party integrations

#### üîç Audit & Monitoring
- **Comprehensive API call logging** with timestamp and metadata tracking
- **Performance monitoring** with health status assessment
- **Business rule violation tracking** for compliance reporting
- **Public API security considerations** documented for production deployment

### Performance Improvements

#### ‚ö° Schedule Generation Optimization
- **Enhanced rest-period calculation** with optimized historical data filtering
- **Improved scoring algorithm** integrating practical hour limits
- **Performance tracking** with sub-5-second generation targets for 50+ staff

### UI & Scheduling Engine Hardening (Current Unreleased Work)

#### üóì Holiday & Day-Type Consistency
- Unified canonical day-type resolution via `computeDayType()` + `getHolidayName()`; late-loaded holidays trigger reclassification (`reclassifyMonthDayTypes`) to keep shift sets aligned.
- Added `updateHolidayBadgesExt(year, { retype:true })` to repaint badges and retype day cells after service hydration (fixes missing October 3rd badge edge case).

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Single Generation Entry Path
- All schedule creation now flows through `ScheduleUI.generateScheduleForCurrentMonth()` with an in-flight guard and legacy global bridge preserved for older bindings.
- Availability hydration enforced pre-generation when remote store is active.

#### üõ† Recovery Workflow Refactor
- Extracted recovery gap detection and fill preview into `_collectCriticalGaps`, `_runRecoveryPreview`, `_applyRecovery` prototype methods.
- Added in-flight prevention + timing logs (`[recovery][preview]` / `[recovery][apply]`).

#### ‚ùó Invalid Shift Highlighting
- Cells now flag assignments whose shift key no longer applies to the recomputed day type (`invalid-shift` + `badge-error`).
- Ensures visibility when holiday/weekend status changes after initial assignment.

#### ‚ôø Modal Accessibility & Routing
- Focus trap, sentinels, automatic `aria-labelledby`, and backdrop/escape close standardized.
- Wrapped existing `modalManager.open/close` to ensure a11y instrumentation always applied.

#### ü™™ Observability & Diagnostics
- Phase logs added for calendar render steps (start, holidays-initial, done).
- Console instrumentation for generation duration and recovery candidate counts.
- Added `runA11yAudit()` utility (prototype) to detect missing roles / labels (not auto-run yet).

#### üîå Event Delegation Progress
- Toolbar, calendar day clicks, and recovery buttons now delegated at document level (reduces per-render listeners).
- Remaining per-pill assignment listeners slated for delegation in upcoming refinement.

#### üßº Misc Improvements
- Removed duplicate search modal close call.
- Normalized modal open/close behavior; deprecated legacy `__openModal`/`__closeModal` with warnings.

#### Planned Next (Not Yet Included)
- Delegate assignment pill & swap button events.
- Integrate busy state (aria-busy) around generation, hydration, and recovery.
- Execute and surface results of `runA11yAudit()`.
- **Memory usage optimization** for extended operational sessions

### Documentation Updates

#### üìö Comprehensive Pilot Documentation
- **GDPR compliance documentation** (9 detailed documents)
- **Complete test protocol** with 80+ validation test cases  
- **Pilot readiness guide** with operational procedures
- **API documentation** for external integration partners
- **Migration procedures** with rollback instructions

### Configuration Changes

#### ‚öôÔ∏è New Environment Variables
- `MONITORING_ENABLED` - Enable/disable monitoring dashboard (default: true)

   ```bash
   # Apply migration
   psql -d scheduler_db -f migrations/008_practical_limits.sql
   
   # Verify migration
   psql -d scheduler_db -c "\d contracts"
   ```
3. **Update application configuration** to enable new features
4. **Train staff** on new practical hour limit functionality
5. **Review GDPR documentation** and update privacy notices as needed

#### Rollback Procedure

If rollback is necessary:
```sql
-- Remove added columns (data loss warning!)
ALTER TABLE contracts DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS weekly_hours_min_practical;
ALTER TABLE contracts DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS weekly_hours_max_practical;  
ALTER TABLE contracts DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS notes_practical_caps;
```

#### üìä Success Criteria
- All test cases in test protocol passing
- Schedule generation < 5 seconds for 50+ staff
- No critical business rule violations
- Monitoring dashboard operational
- GDPR documentation approved by legal/compliance
