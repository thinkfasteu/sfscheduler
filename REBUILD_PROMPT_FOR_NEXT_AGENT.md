# Archived Rebuild Prompt

This file described the emergency rebuild plan while the schedule tab was temporarily removed (October 2025). The feature is now live again, so this prompt is no longer applicable.

Use these sources for the current implementation and workflows:

- `README.md` – environment setup, manual generation workflow, validation, Supabase notes
- `docs/QUICK_REFERENCE_GUIDE.md` – frontline playbook for planners
- `CHANGELOG.md` – history of the rebuild (release v1.3.0)
- `ui/scheduleUI.js` – source of truth for the schedule rendering logic

If you need the historical instructions, retrieve them from git history using `git show <sha>:REBUILD_PROMPT_FOR_NEXT_AGENT.md`.
