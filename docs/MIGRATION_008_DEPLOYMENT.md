## üîÑ Staging Environment Deployment

### Step 1: Pre-Deployment Backup
```bash
# Create full database backup before migration
pg_dump -h staging-db.sportfabrik.de -U postgres scheduler_staging > \
  backup_pre_migration_008_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# Verify backup file created and has reasonable size
ls -lh backup_pre_migration_008_*.sql
```

### Step 2: Apply Migration in Staging
```bash
# Connect to staging database
psql -h staging-db.sportfabrik.de -U postgres -d scheduler_staging

# Verify current table structure
\d contracts;

# Apply migration 008
\i migrations/008_practical_limits.sql

# Verify new columns added
\d contracts;

# Check sample data populated correctly
SELECT id, name, type, contract_hours, 
       weekly_hours_min_practical, weekly_hours_max_practical, 
       notes_practical_caps 
FROM contracts 
LIMIT 5;
```

### Step 3: Staging Validation Tests
```sql
-- Test 1: Verify all existing records have practical limits
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_records,
       COUNT(weekly_hours_min_practical) as with_min,
       COUNT(weekly_hours_max_practical) as with_max
FROM contracts;
-- Expected: all counts should be equal

-- Test 2: Verify practical limits are logical
SELECT id, name, type, contract_hours,
       weekly_hours_min_practical, weekly_hours_max_practical,
       CASE 
         WHEN weekly_hours_min_practical > weekly_hours_max_practical 
         THEN 'ERROR: min > max'
         WHEN weekly_hours_min_practical > contract_hours 
         THEN 'ERROR: min > contract'
         WHEN weekly_hours_max_practical < contract_hours 
         THEN 'ERROR: max < contract'
         ELSE 'OK'
       END as validation_status
FROM contracts
WHERE weekly_hours_min_practical IS NOT NULL;
-- Expected: All records should show 'OK'

-- Test 3: Verify contract type defaults
SELECT type, 
       MIN(weekly_hours_min_practical) as min_practical_range,
       MAX(weekly_hours_min_practical) as max_practical_range,
       MIN(weekly_hours_max_practical) as min_practical_max,
       MAX(weekly_hours_max_practical) as max_practical_max
FROM contracts
GROUP BY type;
-- Expected: Ranges should align with business rules
```

### Step 4: Application Testing in Staging
```bash
# Restart application to pick up schema changes
sudo systemctl restart scheduler-app-staging

# Test application functionality
curl -s http://staging.scheduler.sportfabrik.de/health | jq '.'

# Test practical limits integration
curl -s http://staging.scheduler.sportfabrik.de/api/staff | \
  jq '.[] | {id: .id, name: .name, practicalLimits: .practicalLimits}'
```

### Step 5: Staging Rollback Test
```sql
-- Test rollback procedure (DO NOT RUN IN PRODUCTION)
\i migrations/008_rollback.sql

-- Verify columns removed
\d contracts;

-- Re-apply migration for continued testing
\i migrations/008_practical_limits.sql
```

## üöÄ Production Environment Deployment

### Step 1: Final Pre-Production Checklist
- [ ] **Staging Tests Passed**: All validation tests successful
- [ ] **Application Tests Passed**: Staging environment fully functional
- [ ] **Rollback Tested**: Rollback procedure verified in staging
- [ ] **Maintenance Window**: Production maintenance window active
- [ ] **Team Ready**: All team members available and briefed

### Step 2: Production Backup
```bash
# Create production backup with timestamp
BACKUP_FILE="backup_pre_migration_008_prod_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql"

pg_dump -h prod-db.sportfabrik.de -U postgres scheduler_production > $BACKUP_FILE

# Verify backup integrity
echo "Backup file size: $(du -h $BACKUP_FILE)"
echo "Backup record count: $(grep -c 'INSERT INTO' $BACKUP_FILE)"

# Store backup in secure location
aws s3 cp $BACKUP_FILE s3://sportfabrik-db-backups/migration-008/
```

### Step 3: Production Migration Execution
```bash
# Record start time
echo "Migration 008 started at: $(date)"

# Connect to production database
psql -h prod-db.sportfabrik.de -U postgres -d scheduler_production

# Verify current state
SELECT COUNT(*) as current_contracts FROM contracts;

# Apply migration with timing
\timing on
\i migrations/008_practical_limits.sql
\timing off

# Verify migration completed successfully
\d contracts;
```

### Step 4: Production Validation
```sql
-- Critical validation queries (must all pass)

-- 1. Data integrity check
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_records,
  COUNT(weekly_hours_min_practical) as records_with_min,
  COUNT(weekly_hours_max_practical) as records_with_max,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN weekly_hours_min_practical > weekly_hours_max_practical 
             THEN 1 END) as invalid_ranges
FROM contracts;
-- Expected: total_records = records_with_min = records_with_max, invalid_ranges = 0

-- 2. Business rule compliance
SELECT type, COUNT(*) as count,
       AVG(weekly_hours_min_practical) as avg_min,
       AVG(weekly_hours_max_practical) as avg_max
FROM contracts 
GROUP BY type;
-- Expected: Reasonable averages per contract type

-- 3. No null values in critical fields
SELECT COUNT(*) as records_missing_practical_limits
FROM contracts 
WHERE weekly_hours_min_practical IS NULL 
   OR weekly_hours_max_practical IS NULL;
-- Expected: 0
```

### Step 5: Application Restart and Testing
```bash
# Restart production application
sudo systemctl restart scheduler-app-production

# Wait for application startup
sleep 30

# Health check
curl -f http://scheduler.sportfabrik.de/health || echo "Health check failed!"

# Test API endpoints
curl -s http://scheduler.sportfabrik.de/api/health | jq '.status'

# Test practical limits functionality
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
  http://scheduler.sportfabrik.de/api/staff/1 | \
  jq '.practicalLimits'
```

### Step 6: Monitoring Verification
```bash
# Check application logs for errors
tail -f /var/log/scheduler/application.log | grep -i error

# Monitor database performance
psql -h prod-db.sportfabrik.de -U postgres -d scheduler_production -c "
SELECT query, calls, total_time, mean_time 
FROM pg_stat_statements 
WHERE query LIKE '%contracts%' 
ORDER BY total_time DESC 
LIMIT 10;"

# Verify monitoring dashboard shows healthy status
curl -s http://scheduler.sportfabrik.de/monitoring/health
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Rollback Procedures

### When to Rollback
Execute rollback immediately if:
- Migration fails to complete successfully
- Data validation checks fail
- Application fails to start after migration
- Critical functionality is broken
- Performance degradation exceeds 50%

### Emergency Rollback Steps

#### Option 1: Database Rollback (Fastest)
```bash
# 1. Stop application immediately
sudo systemctl stop scheduler-app-production

# 2. Execute rollback script
psql -h prod-db.sportfabrik.de -U postgres -d scheduler_production \
  -c "\i migrations/008_rollback.sql"

# 3. Verify columns removed
psql -h prod-db.sportfabrik.de -U postgres -d scheduler_production \
  -c "\d contracts;"

# 4. Restart application
sudo systemctl start scheduler-app-production

# 5. Verify health
curl -f http://scheduler.sportfabrik.de/health
```

#### Option 2: Full Database Restore (If rollback script fails)
```bash
# 1. Stop application
sudo systemctl stop scheduler-app-production

# 2. Drop current database (DESTRUCTIVE)
psql -h prod-db.sportfabrik.de -U postgres -c "
DROP DATABASE scheduler_production;
CREATE DATABASE scheduler_production;"

# 3. Restore from backup
psql -h prod-db.sportfabrik.de -U postgres scheduler_production < $BACKUP_FILE

# 4. Verify restore
psql -h prod-db.sportfabrik.de -U postgres scheduler_production -c "
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM contracts;"

# 5. Restart application
sudo systemctl start scheduler-app-production
```

### Post-Rollback Actions
- [ ] **Verify Application**: All functionality working as before migration
- [ ] **Notify Stakeholders**: Inform team of rollback and investigation plan
- [ ] **Document Issues**: Record what went wrong for future resolution
- [ ] **Plan Re-attempt**: Schedule investigation and corrected migration
